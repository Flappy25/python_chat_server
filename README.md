# Python Chat Server
This folder contains all that is needed to run the client side of my Python chat server.
<b>DO NOT EDIT THE FILES</b>, they may break and you won't be able to connect to the server.

# How to connect
1. Run the <b>"python-3.11.3-amd64.exe"</b> program and when installing, check the box that says <b>"add python to PATH"</b>
2. Check if the installation worked by pressing the keys <b>"Windows Icon" + "R"</b> and type in the letters "cmd" and press "enter"
3. Type in the word "python" and if you get no errors than run the file named "Install Module.bat", if a black box flashes on screen that there was an error, if the black box stays on screen and looks like its installing something that its working
4. Run the file that says "run client.bat"  
5. If there are no errors than you can type in your name after connecting and now you can send messages.
